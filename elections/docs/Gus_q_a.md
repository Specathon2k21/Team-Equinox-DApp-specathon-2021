* How do you handle default risks from debtors?

Factoring can take one of two forms either recourse or non-recourse. In a non-recourse factoring scenario, the factor buys the invoice from its client and becomes responsible for its collection. However, in a recourse factoring situation, the factor lends its client against a pending invoice. If the invoice is not paid within a specified time period, the client has to replace it with a new, creditworthy one or pay back the factor.

A non-recourse factoring arrangement eliminates the risk of non-collection off the Business and the risk is solely on the Factor. By comparison, recourse factoring implies a shared risk burden between the factor and its client. We preferred the non-recourse scenario for the following reasons:
* The Factor is motivated by the expected profits. 
* A Factor would always run a credit check on the Debtor to minimize the risk of non-payment which will be made easy on the platform given the Debtor's history of transactions. 
* We also tried to minimise the risk by having the Debtor approve the invoice before the Business is allowed to submit it for factoring.

Are you considering any SLAs from the debtor payment to be linked to the generated interest (that I see you call transaction fee, but be aware this might cause some confusion with the implicit network transaction fee)  to be paid to factors?

We are currently considering having additional submission fees (in addition to network transaction fees) which can be directed as an incentive for the Debtor. The Debtor is only required to pay the full amount to the Factor which will deduct the discount rate (factoring fees) before sending the remaining amount to the Business (less the advance rate). I am happy to explain or discuss more if this is not clear.

What is the estimated APY for the factor investment? How is it calculated?

The typical factoring discount rates are between:   1.15 % - 4.65 %

The average discount rate = 2.9 %

We will consider that most of the invoices are net 60. So the periods are 6 periods per year.

APY = (1 + r / n)^n - 1 = (1 + 2.9 / 6)^6 - 1 = 9.65 %


* Does the debtor put a collateral (or any skin in the game) in order to apply for the factoring service? what is the incentive for debtor to pay his debt?

The Debtor is not the one applying for factoring. The Business will be the initiator of the whole process. In fact, the Debtor does not get any benefits hence the suggestion to give some of the fees to the Debtor as an incentive. 

* Are you considering one factor (one individual/entity) per invoice or is the invoice debt tokenized and distributed among several factors?

We are currently considering this.   

* Does it makes any sense to you to place such a token as a currency within your ecosystem of businesses/debtors/factors/others ?

Yes, but it will have to be a stable coin. The value of the invoice cannot be subject to volatility otherwise Factors will not want to participate.
