# Stakeholder Profile
## Name
Debtor Accounting Department (DAD)

## Characteristics
The DAD is a well established accounting department with a team of experienced capable accountants. They use accounting systems to follow up on their accounts payable and to manage the relationship with their suppliers/service providers (i.e. Business).

## Valuable Contributions
The DAD needs to sign any invoice for the invoice to be accepted on BFactor Platform. Their participation in the process is a must as the invoice ownership will be transferred from the Business to the Factor. The Debtor's buy in ensures the success of the process. 

The Debtor's profile is the most important component of the factoring process as it is very crucial for the Factor's due diligence. The Debtor's history of transactions on the platform represents a major decisive factor. The DAD is the gate keeper of the required information and their contribution to this process is a must.


## Motivations

### Pro BFactor
* Fast and easy autonomous process to manage accounts payable

### Against BFactor
* Resistance to sharing information regarding their accounts and transactions
* Resistance to having a 3rd party involved in their relationship with their suppliers/service providers
